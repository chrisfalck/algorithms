This is a very basic way for me to keep track of practice on algorithms. 
I'll add to this project as time allows, and hopefully make it more aesthetic
in the future. 

If you'd like to see the pages for any reason, clone the repo, and then use 
python to start a local server.
Navigate to the public/ directory in your terminal or command prompt and type 
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
This will start a basic static file http server on your local host. 
This is necessary to avoid cross origin request errors from using a file:// url.
